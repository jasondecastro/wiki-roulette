### WikiRoulette

[Demo of WikiRoulette powered by React](https://wiki-roulette.herokuapp.com)

This project was originally created by [@minouye](http://twitter.com/minouye). 

I decided to take his concept and turn it into a web application using React and Redux for the seamless browsing of random Wikipedia articles. This is solely a learning experience and if you want to use the real deal I suggest going on the original by [clicking here](http://wikiroulette.co).

- [x] Create the main `App` component.
- [x] Create a `Frame` for the Wikipedia article.
- [x] Create a `Buttons` component for the navigation system.
- [x] Create a `Footer` component for instructions.
- [x] Come up with logic for the `next` and `previous` buttons.
- [x] Fetch 100 random Wikipedia articles on initilization.
- [x] Implement `React Router` 
- [x] Create an `About` component and link it with the router
- [x] Deploy on Heroku
- [ ] Optimize performance even more

Whew. This took about 2 days to complete. If you have any suggestions or feedback on the code, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thanks!
